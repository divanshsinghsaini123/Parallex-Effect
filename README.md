# Parallex-Effect
This is my first web development project using HTML and CSS

The parallax effect is a technique in web design where background images move slower than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene and adding to the immersion. This effect can significantly enhance the user experience by providing a dynamic and engaging visual element to the website.
